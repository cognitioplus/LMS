The purpose of this certification course is to equip entry-level mental health and well-being paraprofessionals with the essential knowledge, values, and practical skills to provide safe, ethical, and compassionate peer-based psychosocial support, both online and in community contexts2.
Your primary goal is not to diagnose, fix, or advise—but to listen, hold space, and connect others to help.

1.2 Course Philosophy: Psychological First Aid (PFA)
The entire course is built upon the practical, universal principles of Psychological First Aid (PFA)7.

•	Mental Health Act (RA 11036): Key provisions include the right to access mental health services, integration into primary care, and protection of rights 13.
•	Stigma and Inclusion: Stigma involves negative beliefs (e.g., “People with depression are weak”)14. You help by using person-first language and normalizing conversations15.
 

**Part II: Ethical, Legal, and Digital Practice (Module 2)**
2.1 Core Ethical Principles
Your practice must be guided by these four principles16:
Principle	Meaning in Practice
Autonomy	Respect the person’s right to choose and make decisions17.
Beneficence	Act in the person’s best interest ("doing good")18.
Non-maleficence	"Do no harm." Stay within your scope and refer when necessary19.
Justice	Offer fair, non-discriminatory support to all20.

2.2 Data Privacy Act (RA 10173) and Confidentiality

•	Rule: You must obtain consent and use secure platforms. Never share information without permission22.
•	Exceptions to Confidentiality: Confidentiality must be broken in cases of imminent risk of harm to the client or others, abuse of minors, or court orders23.
2.3 Informed Consent and Boundaries
Obtaining Informed Consent
Informed consent must be voluntary, informed, specific, and ongoing24.
Sample Script:
“Hi, I’m [Name], a trained peer supporter. Our conversation is private, but I can’t keep it secret if you’re in danger. Do you feel okay talking with me today?” 25
Professional Boundaries
Boundaries define your role and protect both you and the client26.
•	AVOID: Social media friendships, over-sharing your own trauma, responding at all hours, or making unrealistic promises 27.
•	Digital Confidentiality Checklist: Use a secure platform (e.g., Signal), confirm consent is obtained, ensure data is anonymized or deleted, and avoid public discussion of cases28.
